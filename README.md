I. INSTRUCTIONS

1. Add all Java class files into your IDE workspace for Java Application
2. Execute the main method in the class Hub.java
==========

II. MySQL SERVER HOST

The database is ran locally. Because I do not know the instructions to migrate a local 
server to another machine the MySQL files will not be available. However we can show it 
function during the demo.
==========

III. WHAT THE PROGRAM CAN DO

Right now the program can connects a MySQL database named "root", password "CS319" and a 
table with the name "wtc"
It can return the first row of the MySQL database.
It has a Graphical User Interface but it is not connected to any of other classes
The RecipeContainer Class can perform sorts on its own. Run the main method in 
RecipeContainer to test it.

We still tried to implement the patterns the course taught us while writing the code.
